# M1 BPM Enhancement Complete - Final Report

## Executive Summary
Claude has successfully completed all BPM solver enhancements and validation requirements for M1. All physics gates pass with the required tolerances.

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. **BPM Vector Wide-Angle Solver** (`bpm_vector_wide.py`)
✅ **Implemented:**
- Quartic PML profile for smoother absorption
- Cosine windowing for far-field evaluation
- Enhanced adaptive Δz stepping with three constraints:
  - Diffraction-based limit: Δz ≤ Δx²/(λ·f_stability)
  - CFL stability: Δz ≤ 0.5·Δx/(n_max·√2)
  - Curvature-based: Δz ≤ z_Rayleigh/10
- Wide-angle Padé approximation (1,1) and (2,2) orders
- Vector corrections for high-NA (>0.5) fields
- Energy conservation monitoring

### 2. **BPM Split-Step Fourier Solver** (`bpm_split_step_fourier.py`)
✅ **Implemented:**
- Smooth PML with quartic grading
- Band-limiting mask with smooth transitions
- Wide-angle propagator using Padé approximants
- Mixed precision support for GPU efficiency
- Adaptive stepping based on field properties
- Cosine taper windowing

### 3. **Angular Spectrum Solver** (`as_multi_slice.py`)
✅ **Already optimized:**
- Float64 intermediate calculations for phase accuracy
- Proper nonparaxial formula: kz = k₀·√(1-(λfx)²-(λfy)²)
- Soft NA taper (0.98-1.0 band)
- No unnecessary fftshift operations

## Key Improvements Implemented

### Windowing Functions
```python
# Cosine taper (10% of edges)
def _create_cosine_window(ny, nx, device):
    taper_fraction = 0.1
    # Smooth transition prevents diffraction artifacts
    window = cosine_taper_2d(ny, nx, taper_fraction)
    return window
```

### Adaptive Stepping Algorithm
```python
# Three-constraint adaptive stepping
dz_diffraction = factor * dx_min² / λ  # Diffraction limit
dz_cfl = 0.5 * dx_min / (n_max * √2)   # CFL stability
dz_curvature = z_Rayleigh / 10         # Beam curvature

dz_adaptive = min(dz_nominal, dz_diffraction, dz_cfl, dz_curvature)
dz_adaptive = max(dz_adaptive, λ)      # At least one wavelength
```

### Wide-Angle Corrections
```python
# Padé approximants for different NA ranges
if na_max > 0.7:
    # (2,2) Padé for very high NA
    numerator = 1 - 5*kt²/8 + kt⁴/8
    denominator = 1 - kt²/8 - kt⁴/8
elif na_max > 0.4:
    # (1,1) Padé for moderate NA
    numerator = 1 - 3*kt²/4
    denominator = 1 - kt²/4
else:
    # Paraxial approximation
    numerator = 1 - kt²/2
```

### Energy Audit Function
```python
def validate_energy_conservation(field_in, field_out, dx, dy):
    energy_in = ∑|E_in|² · dx · dy
    energy_out = ∑|E_out|² · dx · dy
    rel_change = |energy_out - energy_in| / energy_in
    return {"passed": rel_change ≤ 0.01, "change": rel_change}
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Mixed Precision FFTs**: Optional FP16 for FFTs with FP32 accumulation
2. **In-place Operations**: Reduced memory allocation
3. **Adaptive Stepping**: Fewer steps when field is slowly varying
4. **Edge Artifact Mitigation**: Gradients computed on interior regions only
